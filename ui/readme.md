**Local development** <br/>

First make sure the api package is up and running, then:

`git clone {url}`

After cloning: <br />

Copy .env.example to a new file called .env (pictures for movies will not work without the TMDB api key, and still some of them might be missing due to TMDB's incomplete data)

`yarn install`

To launch the app: <br />
`yarn start`
